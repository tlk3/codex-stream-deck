# macOS-only setup

This mode runs Stream Deck and Codex on the same Mac. It needs no Windows PC, relay, SSH, Tailscale, or host-target key. The same plugin package used on Windows launches new tasks and agent links locally through macOS.

## Optional iPhone Nearby pairing

With the LaunchAgent installed, enable the local iPhone node without restarting
Codex:

```zsh
./start-codex-deck.sh mobile-local-config
```

Scan the opened QR code with the iPhone Camera. The listener uses pinned TLS on
one private LAN address; Bonjour never contains the token and Chrome DevTools
remains on `127.0.0.1`. Rotate credentials only when needed with
`mobile-local-config --rotate`, and disable discovery with:

```zsh
./start-codex-deck.sh mobile-local-disable
```

Tailscale remote access remains a separate optional profile; see
[`IOS.md`](IOS.md).

## Install

1. Install `com.simeo.codex-deck.streamDeckPlugin` in Stream Deck for macOS.
2. Extract `codex-deck-launcher-macos-vX.Y.Z.zip`. The official release ZIP is created on macOS so its executable bits are preserved.
3. Install Node.js 20 or newer if `node --version` is unavailable.
4. From Terminal in the extracted launcher directory, run:

   ```zsh
   ./start-codex-deck.sh dry-run
   ./start-codex-deck.sh self-test
   ./start-codex-deck.sh start
   ```

   **Start Codex Deck.command** is the double-clickable equivalent of `start`.
5. Open **Codex Settings > Codex Micro**, configure the native slots, and add the actions from the [recommended layout](../README.md#recommended-15-key-layout). Leave the Windows/Mac target position empty or replace it with another action.

### Stream Deck + knobs

On a Stream Deck +, drag one **Codex Dial** action onto each knob you want to use. The recommended Model Presets, Agents, Actions, and Usage presets, independent rotate/press/touch settings, and the macOS physical verification checklist are in the [Stream Deck + guide](STREAM_DECK_PLUS.md). The guide's checklist is the verification boundary; this setup page does not by itself claim that a specific build completed hardware QA.

If an archive tool removed executable permissions, restore only the two launcher files:

```zsh
chmod +x start-codex-deck.sh "Start Codex Deck.command"
```

## Keep the bridge available

```zsh
./start-codex-deck.sh install
```

`install` copies the watcher runtime into Application Support and installs a per-user LaunchAgent. It does not restart a normal Codex session already open during installation, never launches Codex while the app is closed, and never automatically restarts a running session. If Codex later opens normally without the renderer bridge, task status and usage continue through the normal-launch fallback while renderer-only controls remain unavailable until an explicit bridge-enabled restart.

Update by extracting the new launcher and running `install` again. The stable host identity, optional relay configuration, and user-owned icons are preserved.

## Commands

```zsh
./start-codex-deck.sh dry-run
./start-codex-deck.sh self-test
./start-codex-deck.sh start
./start-codex-deck.sh start --restart
./start-codex-deck.sh install
./start-codex-deck.sh uninstall
```

`start` reuses an existing renderer bridge and otherwise leaves a running normal Codex session untouched. `start --restart` is the explicit restart form. It reports the handoff as accepted, records the eventual completed, rejected, or failed result under `~/Library/Application Support/CodexDeck/restart-handoffs/`, and hands execution to a detached helper before Codex closes. That lets the relaunch finish even when invoked from Codex's integrated terminal. Concurrent requests are serialized, and a stale request cannot close a replacement Codex process. Codex launches through LaunchServices so Input Monitoring/TCC permissions remain attached to the signed app bundle.

## Files

```text
~/Library/Application Support/CodexDeck/
  codex-deck-macos.mjs
  watcher-launch.sh
  codex-micro-bridge.json
  host.json
  watcher-state.json
  watcher.log, watcher.log.1 ...
  watcher.stderr.log             # LaunchAgent/runtime failures
  icons/                         # optional user-owned SVG copies

~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.simeo.codex-deck.watcher.plist
```

State writes are atomic, a PID-directory lock prevents duplicate watchers, and logs rotate at approximately 1 MB with three retained generations. Nothing inside the Codex app bundle is modified or re-signed.

## Diagnostics

```zsh
./start-codex-deck.sh dry-run
tail -n 100 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/CodexDeck/watcher.log"
tail -n 100 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/CodexDeck/watcher.stderr.log"
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.simeo.codex-deck.watcher"
plutil -lint "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.simeo.codex-deck.watcher.plist"
```

## Optional multi-host mode

Only configure `relay-config` when one Windows-connected Stream Deck should also control this Mac. The relay is disabled in Mac-only mode. See [Windows + Mac multi-host relay](MULTI_HOST.md).

## Uninstall

```zsh
./start-codex-deck.sh uninstall
```

This unloads the LaunchAgent and removes its runtime, bridge state, policy state, lock, and logs. It deliberately preserves `host.json`, optional relay configuration, and `icons/`. No Codex application data is removed and Codex is not restarted.
